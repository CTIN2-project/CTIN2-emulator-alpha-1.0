CTIN2 Emulator - Alpha Version

CTIN2 is an experimental Windows emulator designed to run on Termux. Currently in the Alpha stage, this project is a work in progress. The goal is to bring Windows-like functionality to Termux, enabling users to run Windows applications on their Android devices. Since it’s in the Alpha phase, expect some instability and incomplete features, and be prepared for occasional bugs.

At the moment, the emulator is functional but lacks full features, including container management, advanced settings, and fine-tuned compatibility with all Windows applications. The development team is actively working to address these limitations, so future updates will expand its capabilities.

The CTIN2 emulator has been made possible with the integration of Box64 and Wine, which are used to run 32-bit and 64-bit Windows applications. Wine is also configured to allow users to run various Windows programs, though not all programs may function perfectly. Performance can vary depending on your device's specifications, with better results typically seen on devices with Snapdragon 8xx series processors.

Installation and setup are relatively simple, with clear instructions provided in the README file. However, users may need to manually adjust some settings, particularly related to Wine installation, to ensure proper functionality. This version also includes a basic text-based interface built with dialog that allows users to interact with the emulator. Features such as container management, settings, and other advanced functions will be added in future versions.

This project is still in its early stages, and we welcome feedback from users to improve its stability, performance, and compatibility. Please note that CTIN2 is being actively developed, and while it’s functional, it should be treated as an experimental tool at this stage.

Disclaimer: The creation of CTIN2 involved extensive collaboration with ChatGPT (an AI language model) for compiling useful scripts and providing guidance on technical details. However, the core development and implementation were carried out by the project team. As the project evolves, we will continue to refine it, and user feedback will play a vital role in shaping the final product.
